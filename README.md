**Voxify**

Voxify was made by me, awdtheman10. I decided to make it, because well:
1. TTS to Microphone barely exists, never found anything doing something similar
2. Apps like voicemod make you pay for soundboards. I have no limit, and no rate limit, plus 0 internet connection is needed for the app to run. (Cannot say the same for the games you play or stuff, etc)
3. I was lowkey bored of basic soundboard apps like voicemod forcing you to pay for something. Thats not how it should go.
4. You don't actually need a mic for this to work, thats why I included the TTS so you can use this to talk.
5. i was bored when making the first version
6. Many people assume these apps require hundreds of dlls and external files to work or they stop functioning. It works out of the box, and you only need to have a virtual microphone. Even SteamVR's microphone works for this. Its just audio routing.
7. "well its probably a virus if its so tiny and does so big"
Thats the power of programmers.
8. Yes, I know the EXE and .py file are different sizes greatly. Compiling required every dll from the python imports to be bundled with it. Do some research, I used PyInstaller to compile it. You'll find the same app, same size, and same code if you do it as --onefile instead of --onedir.
9. its simple


i hope yall have fun with it lolllzz
