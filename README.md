Voxify was made by me, awdtheman10. I decided to make it, because well:
1. TTS to Microphone barely exists, never found anything doing something similar
2. Apps like voicemod make you pay for soundboards. I have no limit, and no rate limit, plus 0 internet connection is needed for the app to run. (Cannot say the same for the games you play or stuff, etc)
3. I was lowkey bored of basic soundboard apps like voicemod forcing you to pay for something. Thats not how it should go.
4. You don't actually need a mic for this to work, thats why I included the TTS so you can use this to talk.
5. i was bored when making the first version

i hope yall have fun with it lolllzz
